# Esri's MOOC Program : "[Do-It-Yourself Geo Apps](http://www.esri.com/mooc/diy-geo-apps)"
###### 6/9/17 - 3/10/17

## Anyone can build apps on the ArcGIS Platform
You don’t have to be a software developer to build valuable geo-enabled apps that make your communities smarter and businesses more successful. This course will show you how to combine location and narrative in one application to better communicate and broadcast your story, create custom web applications that solve problems in your community, and build powerful native applications for iOS and Android devices without touching a piece of code. If you are a developer, you’ll be interested in Esri’s APIs, SDKs, and the buzzing GeoDev community.

## Syllabus

Geo-enabling means more than plotting dots on a map. This section provides an orientation to the course and thoughts about how geo apps can strengthen communities.
